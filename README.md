## Description

A full-stack web application that uses a NoSQL database to track workouts and exercises. I used Mongoose.js to build the models and created API routes for CRUD operations. The schema Workout contains a date and a subschema of exercises, which includes many user-provided data points such as weight, duration, reps, sets, or distance.
